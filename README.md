# AI-Powered-Fashion-Assistant
Developing an AI-powered fashion assistant that recommends clothing and accessories based on user preferences, current trends, and weather conditions. This project will involve a machine learning model trained on a large dataset of fashion images, weather data, and trend analysis, with a React-based frontend.

Features:
  Personalized Recommendations:
    Users input preferences (e.g., style, favorite colors, occasion).
    AI suggests clothing and accessories tailored to their input.
  Weather-Aware Suggestions:
    Integrate live weather data API to suggest outfits suitable for the weather.
  Trend Analysis:
    Use machine learning to analyze trending styles on social media (Instagram, Pinterest, etc.) and include them in recommendations.
    Virtual Try-On (Optional Advanced Feature):
    Allow users to upload their photos and virtually try on outfits.
  Technologies:
    Frontend: React
    Backend: Node.js with Express for APIs
    Database: MongoDB for storing user data and preferences
    AI/ML:
      Use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image analysis and style matching.
      Use datasets like DeepFashion or Fashion-MNIST for training.
      Leverage libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
    APIs:
      Weather data: OpenWeatherMap API
      Social media trend analysis: Scrape publicly available social media trends using Python tools.
